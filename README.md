# Textpression
A drop-in JavaScript library to make easy and sharable kinetic typography from any text.

### Status
VERY MUCH UNSTABLE AND IN PROGRESS

### Startup
- Open /src/index.html (app homepage) in browser
- Click hamburger in top-left to open sidebar
- Paste text into text field (currently best for poetry, things with short phrases & lots of linebreaks)
- Click "convert" in the debug menu (URL hash is now encoded form of text)
- Click "start" to run the viz (will convert from URL hash, so you don't need to convert every time)
